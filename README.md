intertubes
==========

Social media which cuts out a lot of middlemen, and does a lot of things for you.

The basic idea is to make a set of files available in a container, called a "tube" in reference to characterizations about the nature of the internet by the Senator from Alaska. Access to a tube implies that the user can read the contents, and optionally can be authorized to update them.

The first use scenario I have is to share a set of photos... thus the Top100 folder in this repository.  I have over 600 gigabytes of photos to share, and it's not practical to do so in the conventional sense. InterTubes is part of a bigger picture involving capability based security and other ideas... which I'm still just trying to flesh out.
